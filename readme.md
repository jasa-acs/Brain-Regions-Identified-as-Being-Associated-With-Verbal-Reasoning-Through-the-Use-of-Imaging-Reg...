## Data

### Abstract

The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a research initiative which focuses on characterizing brain and behavior interaction with genetics. A population-based sample of over 9500 individuals is collected.

### Availability

The data can be downloaded at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-
bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000607.v1.p1. However, we cannot share the data directly.

## Code

### Abstract 

We provide our code (main function, all sub-functions, and simulation settings) for replicating the simulation results, which is tested again before submission and can be run easily.

### Description

How delivered: Matlab

Link to code/repository: The code is uploaded together with the manuscript

Version information: R2019a – academic use

Hardware requirements: Our code is run on a MacBook Pro 2018 with 2.6GHz 6-core Intel Core i7 with 16GB RAM. GPU computing is not required.

Supporting software requirements: All required Matlab packages are included in our online code submission.

## Instructions for use

### Reproducibility

What is to be reproduced: All tables and figure from paper How to reproduce analyses: Simulation results can be reproduced following the “ReadMe” file in the online code submission. Real data results can be reproduced after downloading the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort data from the website provided above.
