The main function for our method is SimulationStudy.m.

To replicate the simulation results, please open the main function SimulationStudy.m, change the default directory to the folder "Code". Then the code can be run entirely. The code is tested again before submission.

The "Core subfunctions" folder contains all necessary subfunctions to run our code, a portion of them are borrowed from Hua Zhou's code about TensorReg and SparseReg, downloaded from http://hua-zhou.github.io/software.html

If there're any problems regarding the code, please let the authors know. Thank you very much!
